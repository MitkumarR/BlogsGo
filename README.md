# BlogsGo

BlogsGo is a foundational Go application designed to retrieve and display data from a MongoDB Atlas database. It currently lacks advanced UI and styling, which will be addressed in future updates.

Features to be Added:

Blog composition functionality for users.
Enhanced UI design for a more polished and user-friendly experience.

This project aims to offer similar functionality to [this blog platform](https://blogweb-e1pz.onrender.com/).

How to run:-
Run the application using the "go run main.go" command.
